I recently watched a Netflix series called Unorthodox. It’s about a young girl who grew up in an orthodox Jewish family in New York. One scene in an episode had her in a club for the first time in her life. She didn’t know the music. She didn’t know how to dance. She’s never drank before. Everything was completely alien to her.

The nearest one would probably be in Bratislava, which was about an hour drive away. Since his hotel was so close to the border, Vienna was really the only feasible option.

Before my father came I told him how expensive it was, but he assured me he knew and was experienced in traveling to Austria. Because of the expense I suggested that he stay for five or six days at a hotel in the city in Vienna.

Even though my presence in Peru was to assist my father's missionary work - which was loathsome for me - just being in such different surroundings was invigorating.
