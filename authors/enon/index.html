I'm not just talking about small things, either. But we can start there.</p><p>My father never seemed to want to do even the smallest things himself. I'm not sure if it was laziness or just the fact they he had his family and a church congretation at his disposal, but whatever it was, he always would ask others to do things you or I might not even think of. For example, my father loved to spend time in his library on the first floor of our house. It was adjacent to the steps going to the second floor where all of us kids would usually hang out when he was home.</p><p>The worst thing you wanted to do was to go down the steps when my father was in his library. Why? Because he would hear someone come down the creaky steps and, as soon as he heard footsteps, ask who was there. He would go down the list from mother to my smallest sibling until someone answered. I learned later on just not to answer, but when you are young and scared of your father, you would tend to answer.</p><p>Once you do, he always seemed to have some menial task for you to do: get him some water or diet coke, even though the kitchen was a 10 second walk away; bring in more fire wood for his fire; bring him a magazine/book/newspaper; get someone else for him; rub his hands/feet/eyes (I always hated this and is why I think in adulthood I don't like getting any type of massage). The list was seemingly endless.</p><p>But these are just the small things. I remember him always asking my mother to do his dirty work for him. When I say this, I mean he would ask her to call the landlord for an extension on our rent, to call up someone at his church and ask him for money, or to meet with clients he hasn't filed cases for yet and try to give them an excuse as to why they shouldn't ask for a refund. If my mother wasn't available, he would get someone else in his congretation to do it.</p><p>He even would ask one person in our congretation to ask another church member if my father could borrow money from them or get a car loan for him, instead of asking them himself.</p><p>Maybe it was his pride combined with laziness and a fear of rejection. But when I was growing up a favorite phrase of his was <em>"Do this for me, would you?".</em></p></div></article><article class="page__item"><div class="divider divider--center"><header class="page__item-header"><h2 class="page__item-title"><a href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/ignoring-isnt-a-solution/" class="invert">Ignoring Isn&#x27;t a Solution</a></h2><div class="post__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-10T17:25" class="page__item-date">April 10, 2022 </time><a href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/tags/snippets/" class="post__meta-category">Snippets</a></div></header><p>Having good role models while growing up is important, because you are able to learn in a way that can be beneficial for your life. Bad role models teach you as well, though whether it turns out to be useful or not all depends on your specific circumstances and how you handle with what you learn.</p><p>There are a lot of things I wished I would have learned at an earlier age that could have been helpful in my life. Things I had to find out for myself that, many times, came too late. One of these is that ignoring problems does not make them go away. They just fester and can become a permanent scar.</p><p>My father had a way of ignoring things. It was amazing, really, I remember it happened even from the littlest things up to the largest. He was perpetually late, and whenever we were running late for something he would completely ignore the reality of it, look at the clock, see it says 3:25pm while we are on our way for a 3:30pm appointment and still 20 minutes away, and just say gleefully - we aren't late yet! This somehow let him ignore the repercussions of being late.</p><p>Then there were larger things, like the risk we would lose our house or his impending trial and legal troubles. These are things he would swiftly ignore and pretend that they didn't exist. A point would come when he could no longer do so, and then he would simply run away from the problem or continue to pretend that it didn't exist.</p><p>This wasn't a good role model for being successful in life. When you are young and impressionable, the things your parents do make an impact on you and you can take up habits and traits, good and bad.</p><p>The bad habit of ignoring things is something that took a hold of me for many years and was one I struggled to break free from.</p><p>Ignoring things is never an answer, even if it is the easy thing to do in the moment. This is something I am grateful I finally learned, and something I teach my own children.</p></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/"><img src="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/media/website/CoN-logo-full-white-small.png" alt="Cult of None"></a><div class="footer__copy">Copyright 2022</div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth:'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'#js-header',};</script><script defer="defer" src="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=c18c536b243c409b215b9caf3bed85ce"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
