We had a huge house with nine bedrooms, four cars, two airplanes, and all sorts of modern early 1990s luxuries.I use the term success loosely, however, because it was all about appearances and not real success or stability. Sure, my father drove around in his Mercedes and flew in his airplane, but he was on the brink of losing everything at any moment. For my entire childhood.One thing he would do was buy us kids a lot of gifts for Christmas. Looking back on it now that I am older and wiser, I realize this was more a combination of compensation and selfishness than it was about making his children happy.The compensation was for all of those times he was never there as a father. Never there as his children needed him.The selfishness is equally as simple: knowing my father, he probably just wanted to make himself feel better and also wanted his kids to think he was a wonderful father because he bought them a bunch of stuff with money he actually didn’t have.One year, he decided to take one of his missionary trips to Africa. He had been to Namibia a number of times and was going again. My mother also went and they decided to go over the Christmas and New Year period. Some church members lived in our house with us, and they would manage things and watch us kids while my parents were away. We were always happy, to be honest, because any time away from our father made our life easier.My father always loved Christmas, but not enough to cancel his trip and spend it with his family. He didn't want to miss out, though, on all of the Christmas festivies. Instead of having an early celebration, he decided to make the family wait until my parents returned in the second week of January. But he wanted to make sure that the tree was full of presents.Being only 8 years old at the time, I was conflicted. I was happy my father would be away, but it also felt like cruel torture to see all those presents sitting under the tree for weeks and weeks. We couldn't touch them, and if we did anything wrong while my parents were away, we wouldn't get to open them when they returned.You may be thinking - what's the big deal? We were lucky enough to have a roof over our head and presents under the tree, so why should you complaing?You're right, it's not a big deal, but I provide this as an example about what I felt was true at the time but couldn'd express, and so clearly realized was true when I became older: my father never really cared for others and his actions were only to benefit himself.He could have celebrated Christmas with his family before he left. But he didn't want to. He wanted to make everyone wait for him, so he could have the celebration that he wanted to have on his own terms, regardless of what his family thought or felt.From small and mundane things to big decisions, my father's first thought was always himself."><meta name="generator" content="Publii Open-Source CMS for Static Site"><link rel="canonical" href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/from-the-outside/"><meta property="og:title" content="From the Outside"><meta property="og:image" content="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/media/website/CoN-logo-full-white-small.png"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Cult of None"><meta property="og:description" content="If you were just looking from the outside, at the height of my father’s success it probably seemed like we were well-off.
