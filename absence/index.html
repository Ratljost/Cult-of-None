Thinking about it back then, it marked the longest I’d gone without talking to him since he was in prison.It was refreshing and felt liberating.Being a father myself, I hope my own son never feels that way about not talking to me. But I will never treat him the way my father treated me.The longer I went without speaking to him, the freer I felt. My father beat into us kids - literally and figuratively - that listening to him and pleasing him was all that mattered. This led to an odd and strange sense of obligation for me. I don’t think my siblings felt the same. Maybe they did, but we all had such different experiences. Even though I knew logically all he brought me was misery, I still felt some strange feeling of obligation to my father. This meant I would continue to talk to him and have him in my life.Shortly after I first left, it was much more than that. I was almost afraid of not receiving his approval, even though I had left his church and no longer lived in his house. It caused me to make many decisions I ended up regretting. The choices I made weren’t about what I wanted, but we’re about what I felt would make my father happy.No, scratch that, I knew he wouldn’t be happy no matter what I did. But maybe he wouldn’t berate me and make me feel even more worthless than I felt almost every day of my childhood.My father always taught us to think of other people first. But when he taught us this, it wasn’t because he was trying to instill in his children noble values. It was because he wanted us to think of him first and put him ahead of everything else. After all, he was a prophet and spoke to God himself. Putting our father first was therefore the same as putting God first, which was the most honorable and Christian thing to do.Or so we were taught and led to believe.But it was all lies. It was all to give my father control over us. And that control remained in many ways for years after I left.I once tried talking to a therapist about my past. After hearing my story, he said that he believed deep down I still had the desire that everyone naturally has to please their parents. For most people this is fine. But for me, he said, it was causing me pain and said I should find a way to release myself from this in terms of my father.At the time, I don’t really think I believed that was the case. Even years after leaving I was still encumbered by this lurking shadow, but I felt I freed myself from it years prior.Yet, looking back on it, after I was able to stop speaking to my father, I realized that perhaps there still was some vestige of these feelings left deep inside that caused me to still have a relationship with someone who brought nothing good to my life and was only destructive.It wasn’t as pronounced or harmful to my life as it once was, but it was still there, even if just a little. It’s why I still put up with the craziness that was always around my father.As time went on, and the further my father was from me, the clearer I could see."><meta name="generator" content="Publii Open-Source CMS for Static Site"><link rel="canonical" href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/absence/"><meta property="og:title" content="Absence"><meta property="og:image" content="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/media/website/CoN-logo-full-white-small.png"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Cult of None"><meta property="og:description" content="It had been over two months since I talked to my father.
