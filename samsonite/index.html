I had already lugged down two of the massive suitcases filled with religious literature that we brought with us and my older brother Alex soon appeared with the second two suitcases.</p><p>While we had a short rough patch during our early teenage years, Alex and I have always remained extremely close. If it weren't for him I don't think I would have managed to get through many parts of my life. Peru was exciting yet agonizing in many ways, and having Alex there made it all easier.</p><p>I put my coke bottle - still over half full and cool to the touch - on the front desk and lugged two of the four heavy suitcases out to our van where our driver awaited.</p><p>We had been carrying these suitcases since our departure from home. Through airports, bus stations, trains, hotels, and many times loading and unloading them into different cars, taxis, and vans. Alex and I ruminated amongst ourselves that our father brought us with not to give us a unique experience, but to carry the luggage.</p><p>These suitcases were not the expensive, light kind that you might see today at a high-scale luggage boutique. These were heavy-duty Samsonite 1990s suitcases, and the worst kind. They were heavy themselves, only had two wheels on one end that only allowed you to pull them one way, and they were shaped oddly, with sharp angular edges on the top.</p><p><em>How I loathed those suitcases.</em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 3, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/tags/snippets/">Snippets</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/prologue/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Prologue</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/the-trip-part-1/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> The Trip - Part 1 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2021 - 2022</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
