They were both very vague about the whole thing, but I think they were introduced to it through some friends or by a stranger at a religious event they went to. My parents were not particularly religious at this time. My father was likely more religious than my mother, but neither of them attended a church or had a specific religion they followed. My grandparents on my father's side were Greek Orthodox, while on my mother's side they were general Christian/protestant but, like most families, not practicing.

To be more precise, it was my winter vacation from university of 1998-99. I had successfully completed a year and a half of university and I was slowly starting to realize more and more that I really needed to get out of the situation that I was in if I wanted to keep my sanity. I had a month off from university with nothing to do but hang out at home with my family and try to get away from home as much as possible. I was getting more into computer games then, and&hellip;</p></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-10T11:56" class="feed__date">April 10, 2022</time></div><h2><a href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/relativity/">Relativity</a></h2></header><div><p>When I feel close and comfortable enough with someone, and if the topic of one’s earlier years comes up, I will share a little of my background. I've seen many different reactions to my story. Some I could tell right away were uncomfortable. Others were simply surprised and curious. A common thread I've heard is "I can't believe you got out of that." My childhood and early adult life weren’t any picnic. But I'm not the only one. A lot have had it much harder than I have. It’s all relative to your experiences.

He adamantly said that he did not want to go to a hospital in Slovakia. I told him that I didn't even know if there are any such hospitals close by in Slovakia anyway. The nearest one would probably be in Bratislava, which was about an hour drive away. Since his hotel was so close to the border, Vienna was really the only feasible option. After searching for about 15 minutes I found two hospitals in the Vienna area that seemed decent.
