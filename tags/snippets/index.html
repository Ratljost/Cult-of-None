Thinking about it back then, it marked the longest I’d gone without talking to him since he was in prison. It was refreshing and felt liberating. Being a father myself, I hope my own son never feels that way about not talking to me. But I will never treat him the way my father treated me. The longer I went without speaking to him, the freer I felt. My father beat into us kids - literally and figuratively - that listening to him and pleasing him was all&hellip;</p></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-29T22:26" class="feed__date">April 29, 2022</time></div><h2><a href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/do-this-for-me-would-you/">Do this For Me, Would You?</a></h2></header><div><p>One thing that always fascinated me as I grew up was my father's ability to get others to do things for him. I'm not just talking about small things, either. But we can start there.</p><p>My father never seemed to want to do even the smallest things himself. I'm not sure if it was laziness or just the fact they he had his family and a church congretation at his disposal, but whatever it was, he always would ask others to do things you or I might not even think of. For example, my father loved to spend time in his library on the first floor of our house. It was adjacent to the steps going to the second floor where all of us kids would usually hang out when he was home.</p><p>The worst thing you wanted to do was to go down the steps when my father was in his library. Why? Because he would hear someone come down the creaky steps and, as soon as he heard footsteps, ask who was there. He would go down the list from mother to my smallest sibling until someone answered. I learned later on just not to answer, but when you are young and scared of your father, you would tend to answer.</p><p>Once you do, he always seemed to have some menial task for you to do: get him some water or diet coke, even though the kitchen was a 10 second walk away; bring in more fire wood for his fire; bring him a magazine/book/newspaper; get someone else for him; rub his hands/feet/eyes (I always hated this and is why I think in adulthood I don't like getting any type of massage). The list was seemingly endless.</p><p>But these are just the small things. I remember him always asking my mother to do his dirty work for him. When I say this, I mean he would ask her to call the landlord for an extension on our rent, to call up someone at his church and ask him for money, or to meet with clients he hasn't filed cases for yet and try to give them an excuse as to why they shouldn't ask for a refund. If my mother wasn't available, he would get someone else in his congretation to do it.</p><p>He even would ask one person in our congretation to ask another church member if my father could borrow money from them or get a car loan for him, instead of asking them himself.</p><p>Maybe it was his pride combined with laziness and a fear of rejection. But when I was growing up a favorite phrase of his was <em>"Do this for me, would you?".</em></p></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-21T21:45" class="feed__date">April 21, 2022</time></div><h2><a href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/paging-someone/">Paging Someone</a></h2></header><div><p>There was a paging system in my house when I was a teenager. Each room had a speaker that was connected to one of the main units, one of which was in my parents' bedroom and another that was in my father’s library. Unless the speaker had the mute button on, my parents could listen in on whatever us kids were doing in our rooms through the paging system. The main system could page all of the speakers, and my father would do this whenever he wanted, really loudly through the entire house. Sometimes he would ramble on about something&hellip;</p></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-17T15:17" class="feed__date">April 17, 2022</time></div><h2><a href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/from-the-outside/">From the Outside</a></h2></header><div><p>If you were just looking from the outside, at the height of my father’s success it probably seemed like we were well-off. We had a huge house with nine bedrooms, four cars, two airplanes, and all sorts of modern early 1990s luxuries. I use the term success loosely, however, because it was all about appearances and not real success or stability. Sure, my father drove around in his Mercedes and flew in his airplane, but he was on the brink of losing everything at any moment. For my entire childhood.

Even though it was mid-summer it was only in the 70s outside but inside Ben was met with a rush of cold air. It was like being instantly transported to the middle of a harsh Minnesota winter. Just breathing the cold air can sting your lungs. "What's with the temperature?" Ben asked. "Oh, ah, well, you see, my dad he..."
