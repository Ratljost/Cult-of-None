Bad role models teach you as well, though whether it turns out to be useful or not all depends on your specific circumstances and how you handle with what you learn.</p><p>There are a lot of things I wished I would have learned at an earlier age that could have been helpful in my life. Things I had to find out for myself that, many times, came too late. One of these is that ignoring problems does not make them go away. They just fester and can become a permanent scar.</p><p>My father had a way of ignoring things. It was amazing, really, I remember it happened even from the littlest things up to the largest. He was perpetually late, and whenever we were running late for something he would completely ignore the reality of it, look at the clock, see it says 3:25pm while we are on our way for a 3:30pm appointment and still 20 minutes away, and just say gleefully - we aren't late yet! This somehow let him ignore the repercussions of being late.</p><p>Then there were larger things, like the risk we would lose our house or his impending trial and legal troubles. These are things he would swiftly ignore and pretend that they didn't exist. A point would come when he could no longer do so, and then he would simply run away from the problem or continue to pretend that it didn't exist.</p><p>This wasn't a good role model for being successful in life. When you are young and impressionable, the things your parents do make an impact on you and you can take up habits and traits, good and bad.</p><p>The bad habit of ignoring things is something that took a hold of me for many years and was one I struggled to break free from.</p><p>Ignoring things is never an answer, even if it is the easy thing to do in the moment. This is something I am grateful I finally learned, and something I teach my own children.</p></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-07T22:25" class="feed__date">April 7, 2022</time></div><h2><a href="https://ratljost.github.io/Cult-of-None/complacency/">Complacency</a></h2></header><div><p>It felt so freeing just to have quiet. No screaming. No arguing. No life or death problem that needs to be solved. No abuse. No hitting. Nobody trying to escape and then come back. Not being told you are the devil incarnate. Not being disowned for the 100th time. No psychological torment. No church services filled with rebuke at 6am and 7pm every day. None of it. Gone. It was as if I could finally hear myself breath and think for the first time in my life.

There are different ways you can react to this environment. Some, like my brother Alex, didn't take all the shit that's coming their way and let it be known that what's going on, and the way they are being treated, is bullshit. This can cause a lot of pain in the moment, but doesn't make you anyone's...how shall I put it nicely...well, it doesn't make you feel as used and abused. Others, like myself, just take it and hold things inside as a way to get by.

I recently watched a Netflix series called Unorthodox. It’s about a young girl who grew up in an orthodox Jewish family in New York. One scene in an episode had her in a club for the first time in her life. She didn’t know the music. She didn’t know how to dance. She’s never drank before. Everything was completely alien to her.

I went to the UK and, while it was different, it had many similarities to my home in the midwest. This, however, this was truly different. And I loved it. I loved the complete disconnect from anything that was familiar. Even though my presence in Peru was to assist my father's missionary work - which was loathsome for me - just being in such different surroundings was invigorating. Was this what people meant when they referred to the "travel bug", I asked myself.
